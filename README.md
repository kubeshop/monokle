[Hello Monokle Video]

## Getting Started

Either download an (as of yet unsigned) installer from [releases](https://github.com/kubeshop/monokle/releases) or
clone/build as described below!

- Read the [introductory blog-post](https://medium.com/kubeshop-i/hello-monokle) to get a quick intro and overview
- Ask questions, report bugs, suggest features, join our discussions
  [here on GitHub](https://github.com/kubeshop/monokle/discussions)
- See "Getting Involved" below on how to get involved!

Note: If you download the unsigned binary, MacOs will complain a bit. You need to go to Preferences > Security &
Privacy > General. Text will appear saying "Monokle was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.
Click the "Open Anyway" button. A new pop-up will say "macOs cannot verify the developer of Monokle. Are you sure you
want to open it?", simply click "Move to Bin". No wait, did you? You should have clicked "Open", silly.

## Building / running

### Mac

Clone this repo and build with

```

```

### Windows

Clone this repo, make sure you are running the node version specified in `.npmrc`, then run:
