# Feature Overview

Here is a short list of some of the features currently in Monokle.

A big thanks to the excellent [Argo-Rollouts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/) project on GitHub for
providing plentiful manifests for us to run Monokle against.

## Navigate k8s objects easily

Monokle compiles a list of all the objects in your repo (from files you didn't want ignored), to give you a handy
overview of all your resources - [read more](resource-navigation.md)

## Validate and follow links up- or downstream through your manifests

Surf up- or downstream through your resources! Monokle highlights other resources that your selection has direct
relations to and even provides you with the links to go to them quickly - [read more](resource-navigation.md)

## Preview resources generated by Kustomize and Helm

Do a quick dry-run, enabling you to navigate and debug the resources created by Kustomize or Helm. Apply them to
the cluster if you are satisfied - read more about [Kustomize](kustomize.md) and [Helm](helm.md)

## Locate source file quickly and see if links are dead-ends

When you select a resource, Monokle will show which file it was defined in. A yellow warning triangle indicates that a resource is pointing to a link that does not exist.

## Browse and update your clusters objects

Want to browse your cluster instead of a repo? Simply click the "Show Cluster Objects" button to import all objects from
the cluster into Monokle - [read more](cluster-integration.md). If you need to make any immediate hot-fixes, simply modify
the resource in the source editor and click the "Apply" button.
