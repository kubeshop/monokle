# Feature Overview

Here is a short list of some of the features currently in Monokle.

A big thanks to the excellent [Argo-Rollouts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/) project on GitHub for
providing plentiful manifests for us to run Monokle against.

## **Navigate K8s Objects Easily**

Monokle compiles a list of all the objects in your repo (from files you didn't want ignored), to give you a handy
overview of all your resources - [read more here](resource-navigation.md).

## **Validate and Follow Links Up- or Downstream through your Manifests**

![Follow links up or downstream through your manifests](img/upstream-downstream-1.9.gif)

Surf up- or downstream through your resources! Monokle highlights other resources that your selection has direct
relations to and even provides you with the links to go to them quickly - [read more here](resource-navigation.md).

## **Preview Resources Generated by Kustomize and Helm**

![Preview the resources created by Kustomize or Helm](img/kustomization-1.9.gif)

Do a quick dry-run, enabling you to navigate and debug the resources created by Kustomize or Helm. Apply them to
the cluster when you are satisfied - read more about [Kustomize](kustomize.md) and [Helm](helm.md).

## **Locate Source File Quickly and Find Dead-end Links**

![Locate source file quickly, and see if links are dead-ends](img/find-file-and-dead-links-1.9.gif)

When you select a resource, Monokle will show which file it was defined in. A yellow warning triangle indicates that a resource is pointing to a link that does not exist.

## **Browse and Update Cluster Objects**

To browse a cluster instead of a repo, simply click the "Load" button to import all objects from
the cluster into Monokle - [read more](cluster-integration.md). If you need to make any immediate hot-fixes, simply modify
the resource in the source editor and click the "Apply" button.

## **Manage Multiple Projects**

Easily switch in between projects to more efficiently work with multiple projects at the same time.

## **Compare Resources**

The Editor contains a **Compare Resources** button at the top right.

![Diff Button](img/diff-button-1.9.png)

Selecting **Compare Resources** will open the Comparing Resources window:

Almost anything that you work on in Monokle can be compared. Select from the drop down on the left side and the right side to do a compare of a local resource, a Kustomize or Helm preview or a cluster:

## **Create a Resource from a Template**

Monokle allows the use of templates to start a new project via the **Start from a template** option:

![Start with Template](img/start-with-template-1.9.png)

The **Create a Project from a Template** dialog appears:

![Start with Template](img/name-project-1.9.png)

Name your project, select its location and click **Next: Select a Template**.

Monokle includes a default set of templates which are installed automatically when starting Monokle
for the first time and available in the Templates Explorer when working with your Monokle projects:

![Default Templates](img/template-selection-1.9.png)

Check out the [Monokle Default Templates Plugin](https://github.com/kubeshop/monokle-default-templates-plugin) repository to 
see the complete list of templates that are included along with their corresponding schemas and manifests.
