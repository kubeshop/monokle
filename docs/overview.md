# UI Overview

Monokle is layed out like many other desktop applications:

![Monokle UI](img/monokle-ui.png)

Left to right:

- The vertical toolbar to the far left  allows you to switch between File and Cluster mode.
- The File Explorer (shown in screenshot) shows the contents of the currently selected folder.
- The Navigator in the center shows all resources found in the current folder or cluster. By default it shows all possible
  Resource sections and subsections - when selecting a folder or cluster only those sections that actually contain
  any resources will be shown.
- The Editor section to the right contains editors/views/actions for the currently selected resource or file

The top right contains two buttons
- Settings (see below)
- GitHub -> opens the Monokle GitHub repo in your system browser.
## Settings 

Clicking the Settings icon on the top right opens the settings:

- **Kubeconfig**: sets which kubeconfig Monokle should use for all cluster interactions
- **Files: Include**: which files to parse for kubernetes resources when scanning folders
- **Files: Exclude**: which files/folders to exclude when scanning folders for resources
- **Helm Preview Mode**: which Helm command to use for generating previews (see [Working with Helm Charts](helm.md))
    - Template: uses [Helm Template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template/)
    - Install: uses [Helm Install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/)
## Multiple Windows

You can launch multiple project windows using the New Monokle Windows option. It allows you to work on multiple folders or clusters simultaneously. Thus visual navigation for the recently used pages becomes simpler and faster.   

**Action:** File > New Monokle Windows
