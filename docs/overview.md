On subsequent start-ups, Monokle Desktop automatically loads the most recently selected folder, if the corresponding "Load recent folder on Startup" setting has been enabled:

## **Working with Projects**

Click **Select an existing folder** to add your project folder containing K8 resources. 

Monokle Desktop is laid out like many other desktop applications:

- The vertical toolbar to the far left allows you to switch between File, Kustomize, Helm and View Template mode.
- The File Explorer (shown in screenshot) shows the contents of the currently selected folder.
- The Navigator in the center shows all resources found in the current folder or cluster. By default it shows all possible
