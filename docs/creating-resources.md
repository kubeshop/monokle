# Creating Resources

## **Add a Resource**

While using Monokle Desktop, you can directly add new K8s resources. Once you have browsed and added your project folder, click on the **Create Resource** button at the top of the navigator to launch the **Create Resource** dialog.

While creating a resource, it is possible to select an existing resource as a template from the drop-down menu. The options for this template are **Save to folder**, **Add to file** and **Don't save**.

If the last drop down is left as **Don't save**, that resource will be added to the Navigator resources but it will be yellow and it has a * next to it:

![Unsaved resource](img/unsaved-resource-1.9.png)

These “unsaved” resources will have to be saved by the user to be able to reuse them. Clicking on a yellow resource will show the Save button in the Editor panel to save the highlighted resource.

## **Create a Resource from a Template**

Monokle Desktop allows the use of templates to start a new project via the **Start from a template** option:

The **Create a Project from a Template** dialog appears:

Name your project, select its location and click **Next: Select a Template**.

Monokle Desktop includes a default set of templates which are installed automatically when starting Monokle Desktop for the first time and available in the Templates Explorer when working with your Monokle Desktop projects:
