## Monokle Architecture

Monokle is a "straight-forward" React/typescript application using Redux Toolkit for state-mgmt. 
Visuals are done with antd design and a bunch of fairly common libraries/frameworks are used internally
for common functionality (see components below). 

This project was bootstrapped from
https://github.com/yhirose/react-typescript-electron-sample-with-create-react-app-and-electron-builder, 
which provides

- TypeScript supports for Electron main process source code
- Hot-relaod support for Electron app
- Electron Builder support

See https://www.electron.build/ for more info on electron builder

## Folder structure

- /electron : electron main thread, contains startup code and some ipc handlers invoked from the UI
- /src : root for monokle UI application, contains App.tsx, Index.tsx, etc.
  - /components : UI components - coarse to fine grained; organisms -> molecules -> atoms
  - /constants : constants..
  - /models : type definitions for core objects (see below) and states
  - /redux : redux-related code (selectors, hooks, store, reducers, thunks, services)
  - /styles : styles..
  - /utils : common utility functions
  - /assets : icons/images/etc
  
## Core objects

- Most logic revolves around [K8sResource](../src/models/k8sresource.ts) objects which "encapsulate" all 
data associated with a parsed resource.
- [FileEntry](../src/models/fileentry.ts) objects correspond to a parsed file - which can contain 0..n K8sResource objects
- The [AppState](../src/models/appstate.ts) holds the main state of the application (see inline comments), state
  changes are handled by the [main reducer](../src/redux/reducers/main.ts) and corresponding [thunks](../src/redux/thunks)

## Main UI Components

The content of most high level [organisms](../src/components/organisms) and 
[molecules](../src/components/molecules) should be fairly self-explanatory. A few highlights:

- the [FileTreePane](../src/components/organisms/FileTreePane/FileTreePane.tsx) renders the selected folder
- the [NavigatorPane](../src/components/organisms/NavigatorPane/NavigatorPane.tsx) renders the main resource 
  navigator, including sections for Helm Charts and Kustomizations
- the [Monaco](../src/components/molecules/Monaco/Monaco.tsx) component renders the source editor using the
  Monaco editor (same as used by VS Code)
- the [FormEditor](../src/components/molecules/FormEditor/FormEditor.tsx) component renders nice forms for 
  K8sResources using the react-jsonschema-form component (see below), corresponding schames/uiSchemas are 
  in the [resources/form-schemas](../resources/form-schemas) folder.
