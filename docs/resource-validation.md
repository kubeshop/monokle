# Validating Resources

Monokle Desktop automatically validates all resources of the corresponding Kubernetes 1.22.1 schemas. In the Navigator, a resource that is not validated is shown with a red error icon. A resource with a broken link is shown with a yellow triangle.

## **Inspecting Link and Syntax Validation Errors**

You will see the number of both link and syntax validation errors in resources at the top of the Navigator:

![Link and Syntax Errors](img/navigator-link-and-syntax-errors-header-1.9.png)

Click on the yellow triangle to see a list of the broken links in the current resources:

![Link Errors](img/navigator-broken-links-list-1.9.png)

Click on the red circle to see a list of syntax errors in the current resources:

![Syntax Errors](img/navigator-syntax-errors-list-1.9.png)

Clicking on any item in the broken link or syntax error list will locate the file where the error exits in the Navigator and open the source in the Editor.

This same functionality is available when the error icons are next to the file names in the Navigator:

Hover on the error icon to check the error details and see the corresponding line in the Editor:

## **Inspecting Policy Errors**

Monokle Desktop integrates with the Open Policy Agent and can use Rego policies to validate your resources. This means that validation now goes beyond syntax validation and also ensures that semantics are correct. For example, you can enable a policy that ensures that images no longer use the `latest` tag.

Let's have a look at how you would configure and remediate violations.

When you look at the left sidebar, you will notice that a new icon is available for resource validation. Clicking on the icon will open a drawer:

![Open validation drawer](img/validation-overview-1.9.png)

This is the new home for all modules related to validation. Continue by clicking on the Open Policy Agent integration and you will see a set of rules:

![Open OPA drawer](img/opa-table-1.9.png)

Here you can familiarize yourself with the available rules. We recommend enabling all of them and afterwards disabling those that generate too much noise for your use cases.

Great! Policy validation is now enabled. Policy errors have the same behavior as syntax errors. This means that you will see a red error icon appear whenever a violation is detected.

After opening the resource in your editor, you will notice that the error is also marked in the gutter and highlighted. Hovering over the error will show you help on how to remediate the violation. Use this information to directly edit your resource and the errors will disappear in real-time.

### **Policy Rules**

A big shout out to the DefSec team at [Aqua Security][aqua] as full credit for these rules goes to them. You can find the source of the Rego policies [here][aqua-defsec].

An overview of available rules:

### **Policy Validation FAQ**

**How does it work?**

Under the hood, Rego policies are compiled to web assembly. Monokle Desktop uses [the opa-wasm NPM module][npm-opa-wasm] to load the policy and evaluate your resources in real-time.

**Can I use this with Helm and Kustomize?**

No, in this first release only vanilla Kubernetes resources are validated. Let us know if this is something you need by liking our related [Helm][github-validate-helm] and [Kustomize][github-validate-kustomize] GitHub issues.

**Can I use my own Rego policies?**

No, currently only a set of preconfigured rules is available. We are considering [policy plugins][github-custom-rego] or [an OPA Gatekeeper integration][github-opa-gatekeeper], feel free to let us know if this is something you'd like!
