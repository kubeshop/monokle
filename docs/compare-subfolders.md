# Compare Subfolders

Monokleâ€™s Compare & Sync feature allows subfolder comparison, which is helpful when your main configuration folder structure is complex and contains multiple subfolders with different content for the same resources. For example, when you have a GitOps repository with different folders for each target environment.

Here we are comparing resources in the production and staging folders:
