# How to Configure Monokle

In this tutorial, we will show the steps to configure Monokle Environment. 

<em>**Note:** All settings are initialised with default values - there is no immediate need to change them. </em>

Letâ€™s get started! 

## 1. Open Settings

## 2. Set kubeconfig

Enter the kubeconfig file path in the KUBECONFIG text field. The kubeconfig parameter is used when viewing cluster
resources and applying/diffing local resources to a cluster.

<em>**Note:** The kubectl command-line tool uses kubeconfig files to find the information for choosing a cluster and communicating with the API server.</em>

## 3. File Includes

Monokle will look for kubernetes manifests in files matching this filter, by default this is set to *.yaml / *.yml files.
Click on the Add Pattern button to include the files having the corresponding extension.
