Once you select a resource, its source code will be launched and highlighted automatically in the editor. 

Now you can edit the resource in the editor, any changes you make will be automatically saved.

> See [Resource Editing](../resource-editing.md) for more information on how to edit resources.

## 6. Editing your resource

Right-click on the editor to launch the editing menu.

The editing menu includes the following options:

- **Go to Symbols:** Select the Go to Symbol option to perform a focused search of code for finding specified symbols quickly.
- **Change all occurrences:** Select the Change all Occurrences option to replace all string occurrences in the code with any other regular expression.
- **Format Document:** Select the Format Document option to organize the source code for better readability.  It addresses font size, spacing, margins, alignment, columns, indentation, and lists.
- **Cut:** Select the Cut option to delete the unnecessary data. After you cut the text, it gets stored in the clipboard so you can use it later.
- **Copy:** Select the Copy option to copy a piece of code. Thus you can reuse the code to save development time.
- **Paste:** Select the Paste option to paste a piece of code. It helps in reducing the repetition of efforts required to write and test code.
- **Command Palette:** Select the Command Palette option allows you to access keyboard shortcuts quickly for the most common operations.
- <em>**Note:** Editor provides autocomplete and autosave options.</em>

Thus, you can navigate K8s resources and edit their manifests.
