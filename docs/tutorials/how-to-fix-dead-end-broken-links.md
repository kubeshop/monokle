## How to Fix Dead-End Broken Links?

Monokle is a fully integrated IDE for managing manifests. It provides instant access for debugging Kubernetes resources without looking into the YAML syntax. 

In this tutorial, we have illustrated the steps to fix dead-end broken links. 

Letâ€™s get started. 

**Step 1:** Launch Monokle and click on the Browse button to add your project folder containing K8 resources. 

<em>**Note:** Please follow this [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide to install Monokle ðŸš€</em>

**Step 5:** Scroll down in the navigator and hover over a resource link with a warning signal.

<em>**Note:** The link with a warning signal indicates that itâ€™s broken and leads to a dead endpoint.</em>
