# Contributing to Monokle Desktop

If you're interested in contributing to Monokle Desktop that's great - we love you!

Please follow these steps to get started:

- Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kubeshop/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Fork/clone the Monokle Desktop repo and make sure you can build/run Monokle Desktop as described in [Development](development.md).
- Have a look at the high-level [Architecture](architecture.md) document to get an overview of Monokle Desktop's architecture.
- Either start working on an idea of your own that you would like to contribute - or have a look at 
  the [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/kubeshop/monokle/issues) - focus on those assigned to 
  an upcoming [milestone](https://github.com/kubeshop/monokle/milestones).
    - To help you find a good issue to start with we have labeled easy issues with [Good first issue](https://github.com/kubeshop/monokle/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
    - Once you've found an issue, fork / clone the Monokle Desktop repo and start working on it, and let us know 
      by commenting on the issue (so we don't start working on it also).
- Once you've implemented the issue open a PR back to the Monokle Desktop repo so we can review and give you feedback. When all is 
  good we will approve the PR so it can be merged.
- If you've decided to move on to even greater things without finishing the issue that's fine 
  also (kudos for dedicating some time to an open-source project!), let us know so we can plan accordingly!

Always feel free to reach out to us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uNuhy6GDyn) if you have any questions on any of the above - or 
anything else Monokle Desktop-related.

Thank you!
