# Using Monokle Desktop vs Monokle Cloud

Monokle is available via both a locally installed desktop version and a cloud version to use without having to install in your environment. Monokle also includes a CLI and GitHub action that can be used to integrate in your development workflow.


## **Monokle Desktop**

The desktop version focuses on enabling anybody to manage manifests and configuration independently of their knowledge level, before and after deployment, with specific features for creation of content easily through templates and snippets for single developers and platform engineers.

To start working with Monokle Desktop, please follow this [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide ðŸš€</em>.

## **Monokle Cloud**

Monokle Cloud focuses on configuration visibility and policy enforcing. It helps to improve the security of the deployments in GitOps adding information about resources and policies applicable, making it easier to make decisions about whether to merge or not a PR, through the use of linters, policies and RBAC into the PR process and allowing collaboration.
