# Cluster Compare

The Cluster Compare functionality allows you to compare a set of local resources (vanilla or generated with 
Helm/Kustomize) to the resources in your clusters:

- Easily see which of your local resources are different in the cluster.
- Deploy your local resources to the cluster.
- Replace your local resources with the ones from the cluster.
- Compare the resources from Helm chart and Kustomize previews to the cluster resources.

To use Cluster Compare follow these steps:

- Browse to a folder containing manifests / kustomizations / Helm charts.
- Preview the desired kustomization or helm values file.
- Select the desired cluster context in the Cluster tab to the left.
- Press the "Cluster Compare" button at the top of the Resource Navigator:
